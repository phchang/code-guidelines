### Comments
[When Good Comments Go Bad](https://blog.codinghorror.com/when-good-comments-go-bad/):
> **The best kind of comments are the ones you don't need.** The only "comments" guaranteed to be accurate 100% of the time-- and even that is debatable-- is the body of the code itself. Endeavor to write self-documenting code whenever possible. An occasional comment to illuminate or clarify is fine, but if you frequently write code full of "tricky parts" and reams of comments, maybe it's time to refactor.
